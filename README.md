# bhg-final-project
This project demonstrates concepts on how a person's files can be accessed.
Using steganography, an executable that searches for files and uploads them to a server can be embedded in an image.
This can be used to access sensitive files from a victim's computer. 
We also have a program that detects when an image might contain an executable, so a user can be aware of potential attacks.

# Three parts:​
## Steganography​
## HTTP File Transfer​ 
## Detecting Embedded Executables​

For more details on how the project can be run, view the README docs in each directory.
